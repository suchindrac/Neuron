# This is a language proceesing code

## Disclaimer

I know that this seems dumb in the age of AI. However, this has been done only for my satisfaction. I have decided to work on this for the next 20 years

## Idea

The idea is to make a software version of code that __creates neurons__ based on text that is input as of now, connects the verbs to the nouns and answers questions related to what
is taught to the software

As of now it just:

1. Creates neurons (which are called nodes)
2. Stores information as part of neurons
3. Tries to interpret some english language sentences
4. Identifies verbs and nouns
5. Connects verbs and nouns to each other

The next part is to:

1. Answer queries based on data input
2. Create independent processes that process the data and __generate more data or facts from that__
3. Input a lot of data starting from __a for apple__, __b for ball__, __c is the third letter in english alphabet__ and so on
4. Finally possibly if I live to write the code after 20 years, then it will possibly be my girlfriend
