We won't get connections if they are not created -> This happens when only nouns are stored as nodes
We store Jayanagar as a noun now
We store only pizza, delivery and place, instead of 'pizza delivery place' as part of ph_data now
We don't connect all verbs created till now with all nouns created till now
 We just do that connection on the basis of individual sentences
